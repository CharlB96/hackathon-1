Art portfolio is a site that will enable art lovers to discover new artists and styles, giving them the ability to buy or commission art from independent artists.  The artists will be able to showcase their work and attract potential buyers whilst keeping their fans up to date. 

The site will enable customers to discover new and emerging artists whose work aligns with their artistic taste. It will be accessible for all enthusiasts regardless of budget by providing customers the opportunity to not only buy original artworks but also prints or smaller pieces.
